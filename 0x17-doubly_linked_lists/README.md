## Doubly Linked Lists

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of which contains two pointers: one to the next node in the list and one to the previous node. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes in the middle of the list, as well as traversal of the list in either direction.
