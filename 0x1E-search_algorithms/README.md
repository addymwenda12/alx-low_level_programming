# Algorithms
The following algorithms are currently available in this project:
**Binary Search Algorithm (C):** This is an efficient searching algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array.
**Linear Search:** Searches an element in an array by checking each element individually.
**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Worst Case Scenario, where n is the size of the array.
**Jump Search:** Uses a 'jump' size to check fewer elements compared to a linear search.
**Exponential Search:** Similar to binary search but instead of searching the middle element, it searches a smaller sub-array to find the breakpoint.
